Task 528
==============

I've completed an nnUNet model that was trained on all of the NIFTIs in BOBS Repo and 9000 synthetic images generated by SynthSeg, which were also based on BOBS Repo. It must have pairs of T1w and T2w images as input.

I can't tell you how good it is because I've used all the data for training, so none was left over for testing.  However, a lower bound on how good it is would be the metrics calculated by Jacob Lundquist and Timothy Hendrickson, in their 10-fold validation that was ran on the same data.

The model is here:

```

[infer_agate.sh](./infer_agate.sh) illustrates how to do inference using this model.
