Task 510: BCP_ABCD_Neonates_Augmentation
===========================

* Deep learning segmentation with `nnU-Net` and `lab2im`
* **avg dice: 0.88**
* 5 augmented images per genuine image
* use the same distribution for lab2im as the paper (normal distribution)
* Skull is on for all the original images.  However, since the skull is not labelled as such---it's labelled `0`---in the original images, it cannot be generated by `lab2im`.
