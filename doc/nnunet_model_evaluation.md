# Title

Every SOP will have a unique title depending on what its outlining.

## Introduction
Some companies like to include a reminder of the organizations mission.

## Scope of SOP
This section covers the purpose of the SOP and the process it covers and why its important to follow the enclosed steps, like compliance and/or safety.

## Contacts
Every SOP should identify who the document is intended for, list roles and responsibilities, and contact information for coordinating personnel.

## Glossary

* *BIBSNet*: This BIDS App provides the utility of creating a nnU-Net anatomical MRI segmentation and mask with a infant brain trained model for the purposes of circumventing JLF within Nibabies.
* *[nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet)*: nnU-Net is a semantic segmentation method that automatically adapts to a given dataset. It will analyze the provided training cases and automatically configure a matching U-Net-based segmentation pipeline. No expertise required on your end! You can simply train the models and use them for your application.
* *[SynthSeg](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg)*: The first deep learning tool for segmentation of brain scans of any contrast and resolution

## Step-by-step process

1. Visual inspection (by Fez is ideal)
2. Dice coefficient measures
3. Communicate with people who add new models (I think this is Barry currently?) before and after testing

## Checklists
Often, itemized checklists are easier to follow and some SOPs might be better described in this form.
